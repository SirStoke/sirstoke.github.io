<h2 id="we-need-to-go-deeper">We need to go deeper</h2>
<p>At this point I knew that I needed to do what all the cool kids are doing nowadays and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy">totally buy</a> IDA Pro, but I wanted to try and go on the open source path. So I again turned to Google and found <a href="https://rada.re/r/">radare2</a>, and even better I found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter">Cutter</a>, an experimental GUI for radare2.</p>
<p>I should also point out that I was reversing the x86 version of the packer because I am just more accustomed to x86 assembly. Sorry not sorry.</p>
<p><code>Readelf -a</code> never fails to amaze me and it found multiple entrypoints:</p>
<p><img src="/images/libexec_entrypoints.png" alt="YOU GET AN ENTRYPOINT! AND YOU GET AN ENTRYPOINT! EVERYONE.." /></p>
<p>Fired Cutter up, opened <code>x86/libexec.so</code>, added a symbol to <code>+0x3b530</code> and started looking around.</p>
<p><em>Everything</em> except the bytes around that function look gibberish, and that usually is pretty promising. I spark with joy recognizing some <code>INT 0x80</code> after <code>mov eax, 9</code> (mmap).</p>
<p>I see that Cutter has a big play button, and after sprinkling breakpoints on some <code>call</code>s I click on it. Cutter suddenly switches to an horrible black theme and <code>push</code> instructions don't seem to work (they literally don't put the value on the stack).</p>
<p>At the time of writing Cutter is considered beta software. Maybe learning radare2 cli can help?</p>
<p>I spend the rest of the evening reading the radare2 <a href="https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/">official book</a> (it looked <em>very</em> cool) and already being a vim user I felt quite at home.</p>
<p>But I was still having problems with actually running the function.</p>
<p>I decided to chat about this project with a <a href="https://twitter.com/wsxarcher">dear friend</a> of mine that works in the cybersecurity field and he recommended <a href="http://www.giovanni-rocca.com/">Giovanni Rocca's blog</a>.</p>
<p>After reading Giovanni's blog (<a href="http://www.giovanni-rocca.com/giving-yourself-a-window-to-debug-a-shared-library-before-dt_init-with-frida-on-android/">this</a> particular article to be precise) I am convinced I need to use <a href="https://www.frida.re/">frida</a> and that, in general, I must continue my dynamic analysis on a real phone. Time to root my OnePlus 6. And I need to do this on Windows. Darn it.</p>
<p>TL;DR for the day: Wasted an evening learning radare2, ended up using Frida AND needed to use the worst OS I could end up using.</p>
